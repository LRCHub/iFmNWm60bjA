Jivin' Sam from the heart of Harlem
Was a racket layin' cat when it came to the ladies
Jivin' Sam when his gaze was high
That cat could fly from Heaven to Hades
Truckin' along the avenue, watchin' the chicks roll by
He'd laugh and lean and with a sweet refrain
Jivin' Sam would cry

He said (Yes, yes, yes, yes)
I know just how you feel
(Yes, yes, yes, yes)
I can tell from the way you reel
I like your eyes, I like your smile
Admire the way you walk (Yes, you love it)
Adore your size, I think it's wise
To get together like birds of a feather
Yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, I'm livin' in a great big way
(Yes, yes, yes siree)
Everything about you appeals to me
Honey, please quit your stallin'
Baby, can't you see I'm fallin'
Yes, yes, yes, yes
I'm fallin' in love with you

Play it, Pops! Play it, Pops!
Yes, you thrills me, son!
Talk to Papa, Ray, talk to Papa!

Yes, I'm livin' in a great big way
Oh, and this stuff is here and it's wastin' away
(Honey) Please quit your stallin'
(Baby) Now can't you see I'm fallin'
Yes, yes, yes, yes
I'm fallin' in love with you
Oh, baby, in love with you
