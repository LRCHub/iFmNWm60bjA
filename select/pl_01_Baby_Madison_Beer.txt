Baby, baby,
tell me what's the antidote
Wouldn't text you this late
unless there's something wrong
I look too good to be
in this bedroom
Without someone to touch me
like you do
Maybe there's something
I can take for this
How much longer
I gotta wait for this?
I can see my body on your lips,
on your lips, yeah
You know
once you get a taste for it
You will need it,
you would pay for it
Go and empty out the bank
for this
If you wanna be my baby,
know I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy,
I'm the best you've ever had,
yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on,
on, on?
If you wanna be my baby,
know I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy,
I'm the best you've ever had,
yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on, on?
Keep you coming back for more
Baby, baby,
do I taste like candy
Sugar coated,
he say I'm the most sweet
I'm a handful,
but that's what hands are for
Pin me to the floor,
treat it like it's yours
Maybe there's something
I can take for this
How much longer
I gotta wait for this?
I can see my body on your lips,
on your lips, yeah
You know
once you get a taste for it
You will need it you would pay
for it
Go and empty out the bank
for this
If you wanna be my baby,
know I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy,
I'm the best you've ever had,
yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on,
on, on?
If you wanna be my baby,
know I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy,
I'm the best you've ever had,
yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on, on?
Keep you coming back for more
Alone and I'm feeling myself,
but ooh, baby
It's better when I have
some help from my baby
I got that love
you can't handle, but maybe
You can try
I look too good to be up
in this bedroom
With someone like you
to touch me like you do
Whisper my name in my ear,
that's like music
You know just what I wanna hear,
yeah
If you wanna be my baby,
know I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy,
I'm the best you've ever had,
yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on,
on, on
If you wanna be my baby,
know I'm gonna drive you mad
Probably gonna call me crazy,
I'm the best you've ever had,
yeah
I can turn you on, on, on
Why your clothes still on, on?
Keep you coming back for more
